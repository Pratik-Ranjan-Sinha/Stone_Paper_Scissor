This Game is Exact Similar to a Game named Stone, Paper and Scissor where a player have three win cases:

if player 1 selected stone and computer selected paper or vice versa : then paper will cover stone and paper wins hence, Computer wins
similarly, if player 1 selected stone and computer selected scissor or vice versa : then stone will break the scissor and stone wins hence, player 1 wins
similarly, if player 1 selected scissor and computer selected paper or vice versa : then scissor will cut the paper and scissor wins hence, player 1 wins.

So here I will code the game stone paper scissor instead of snake water gun
